## **üìä Week 1 Statistics**

**Total Lines of Code:** \~1,360

**Python Files:** 8

**Concepts Learned:** 15+

**Hours Invested:** 15.5

**Projects Built:** 7

**Skill Progression:** Day 1: 0/10 ‚Üí Day 4: 7.7/10 average

## **üéØ Most Important Learnings**

1. **Programming is about breaking problems down** \- Every complex program is just simple steps combined.  
2. **Databases make everything faster** \- Moving from JSON to SQLite was a game-changer.  
3. **APIs let systems talk to each other** \- Understanding this unlocks full-stack thinking.  
4. **Git saves everything** \- Never lost work after mastering commits.  
5. **Documentation matters** \- Future me will thank present me.

## **üîÑ What I'd Do Differently (Reflection)**

* **What was inefficient or took too long to understand:**  
  * **Git Branch Mismatch:** Initial confusion between master and main branches and resolving the conflict required the git branch \-M main command. Debugging this was critical for future professional workflow.  
  * **Network Tunneling/404 Error:** Setting up ngrok took a significant amount of time, and the final 404 error (likely an endpoint path mismatch) was frustrating but taught me the importance of checking exact URLs and server logs.  
  * **Cross-Platform Commands:** Powershell syntax limitations added friction compared to Linux/Bash; learned to be specific about command execution environments.  
* **What shortcuts I discovered:**  
  * **FastAPI's /docs endpoint** is the quickest way to test API functionality without needing external tools like Postman immediately.  
  * **Using relative paths** for SQLite databases made the code instantly portable across different machines.  
  * **Adopting f-strings** early on dramatically improved code readability for displaying variables.
